# pewlett_hackard_analysis

## Overview of Analysis
Our analysis was performed to determine the number of employees that are expected to retire, and their respective departments, in the coming years. We then set out to implement a plan that allows these employees to partially retire, while also providing mentorship opportunities to new employees. This part of the analysis addressed the looming dynamic of the large number of people retiring.

## Results
- There will be 72,459 roles to fill in the coming years according to those that will be ready to retire in the next few years.

- Employees have held multiple roles in multiple departments, meaning they could provide mentorship in different deparments, rather than only the department they are currently in.

- There are 1550 staff eligible to mentor younger staff based on the retirement data. 
- Based on the retirement titles table, there are many more staff eligible to retire at the senior engineer and senior staff level, than there are at the engineer, staff, technique leader, assistant engineer, or manager level.

## Summary
- As retirement rate booms, there will be 72,459 employees eligible for retirement at pewlett hackard. 
- While there might be enough employees at the senior engineer and senior staff level, there are certainly not enough staff members at the more junior levels, and the 'manager' level is woefully underrepresented on this metric, with only 2 in the respected retirement range. 
- I would like to look at the departments of different retirees instead of just the titles. I think this would be more insightful in determining which departments need mentoring than the titles metric.
- I would also like to determine everyone that has held positions in different departments, so that we can allocate mentorship resources effectively.
